##Introduction

	Our project “The Bike Kollective” is an Android app for free, public bike sharing. We have accomplished a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing app that serves our community and helps curb negative environmental impacts through promoting greener and more economical ways of transportation
##Software in User’s Perspective
  The Bike Kollective is a bike-sharing platform where users can share their bikes with others, free-of-charge. Users can perform a variety of tasks including account signup/login via Google Authentication, creating bike listings where they enter information and add a photo for their bikes, viewing all the bikes available in our inventory, editing their existing bike listings checking out a bike,  returning a bike when they no longer need it. Users are required to sign a waiver when they check out a bike.
